# Calculate daily calorie intake for your puppy

Puppies are growing fast and their energy requirement shifts almost from week to week. DER (Daily Energy Requirement) of the puppy is calculated based on RER (Resting Energy Requirement) multiplied by the energy needs factor. 
Depending on what percentage of the expected adult dog weight was achieved by the puppy, the energy needs factor changes. Keeping track of all the variables may be challenging. 

This webapp helps dog owners to quickly calculate DER for their growing puppies.
